                    Solar energy is free of charge. Once you have installed solar panels on your roof, you will be able to

                    anymore. This is a huge advantage, as electricity prices are constantly increasing. In addition, you
                    will not have to pay for electricity during the night, as your solar panels will generate electricity
                    during the day, and store it in your battery. This electricity will be used during the night, and you
